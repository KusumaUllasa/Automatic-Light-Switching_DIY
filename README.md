# Automatic-Light-Switching_DIY
This is a DIY project made by our Team-9 of Section-11. 
The system is to switch on/off the lights in a room automatically when people enter the room.
IR sensor is used to detect the people passing by. The system counts the number of people entered and exited the room. Also, it shows the time period for which the light was on, after it is turned off.
